# Setting up VirtualBox

These are the high-level steps required to get a meza installation up and running on your computer.

## Downloads and Installs
1. Download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  1. On Windows only, you also need to use this for the Git Bash terminal (once installed right click on any window and select "git bash here")
1. On Windows only, install [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) (You probably want the "Windows MSI installer")
1. Download [CentOS 7 minimal install](http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/) into your home directory (e.g. `echo $HOME`)
1. Clone the meza repository in your terminal: `cd $HOME && git clone https://github.com/enterprisemediawiki/meza`

## Create a new VM
5. Create a new Virtual Machine (VM) in VirtualBox:
  1. Change to meza's scripts directory: `cd meza/scripts`
  2. Run the Create VM script: `./create-vm.sh` and follow the prompts. You need at least 10GB of disk space for a basic install.
6. Install CentOS onto your new VM: Start the VM and follow the prompts.
  1. If you intend for this VM to have a large amount of wiki data (requiring >50 GB for the database, uploaded files, and any backup files from another server), you'll need to configure partioning at the "Installation Summary" screen, via "Installation Destination". Under "Other Storage Options", select "I will configure partitioning." Upon clicking "Done" you will be prompted to configure partition allocation. You can "Click here to create them automatically" and then make adjustments. For an example with 100 GiB total, if you allocate 1 GiB to `/home` you can then allocate 100 GiB to `/`. It will automatically adjust to allocate as much as possible from the remaining amount while leaving enough for `/boot` and `swap`.

## Configure the VM
7. Once installed, you'll need to get networking started. Unfortunately in these first few steps you can't copy/paste, so you'll have to type these manually:
  1. Start the necessary network `sudo ifup enp0s3`
  2. Get the VM network setup script: `curl -L vbox.getmeza.org > vbox`
  3. Run the VM network setup script: `sudo bash vbox`
  4. Confirm SSH works (both commands assume you used the default IP address in the `dev-networking.sh` step above):
    1. For Mac/Linux/Unix, open your terminal and run `ssh root@192.168.56.56` or `ssh yourusername@192.168.56.56`
    2. For Windows, open PuTTY and type 192.168.56.56 into the "Host Name (or IP address)" field and hit "Open" then login with your credentials
8. Shutdown your VM: `sudo shutdown -h now`
9. Take a snapshot and call it something like "baseline configuration". Click the "snapshots" icond in the top-right of VirtualBox and then click the camera icon. You'll be able to jump back to this point at any time.
10. Go back to the main [README](../README.md) and follow the steps to install meza
